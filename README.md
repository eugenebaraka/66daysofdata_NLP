# Day 1 of 66daysofdata

In my journey of #66daysofdata, I decided to start with the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Today, I started with familiarizing myself with the NLTK library as well as some of the fundamental vocabularies (tokens, types, and lexical richness). **Tokens** are the number of characters in a text. **Types** are distinct and unique tokens in a text while **lexical richiness** is the percentage of distinct tokens in a text. See you again tomorrow!
