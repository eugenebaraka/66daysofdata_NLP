# Day 1 of 66daysofdata

On my journey of #66daysofdata, I decided to start with the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Today, I started with familiarizing myself with the NLTK library as well as some of the fundamental vocabularies (tokens, types, and lexical richness). **Tokens** are the number of characters in a text. **Types** are distinct and unique tokens in a text while **lexical richness** is the percentage of distinct tokens in a text. See you again tomorrow!

# Day 2 of 66daysofdata

Today, I touched on the overview of NLP usecase, including speech recognition, machine translation, and textual entailment. I also learned that NLP still has a lot of limitations such as performing common-sense reasoning or drawing on world knowledge to perform tasks. Here's is my image of the day. It explains the spoken dialog system pipeline. Now I have a high level understanding of how my Google Assistant works! Can't wait for tomorrow!
